The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made for comparing NEMO 3.6 and 3.4 simulations.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).
